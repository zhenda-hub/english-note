## 动词语法

### 被动语法

be + 过去分词

need -> be needed


### 第三人称单数

have -> has

只影响一般现在时，其他时态不用纠结。

### 动词的时态


过去分词: 动词 + ed

| 用法       | 结构                | 例子                      |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| 现在完成时 | have/has + 过去分词 | I have **eaten**          |
| 被动语态   | be + 过去分词       | The homework was **done** |
| 作形容词   | 过去分词修饰名词    | a **broken** window       |




实际上英语真正常用的时态只有：

现在 / 过去 / 将来 × 简单 + 进行 + 完成 = 9 种常用。

简单时： I eat / I ate / I will eat
进行时： I am eating / I was eating / I will be eating
完成时： I have eaten / I had eaten / I will have eaten
这 9 个覆盖 99% 的实际使用场景。
